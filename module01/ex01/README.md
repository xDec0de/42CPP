# Exercise 01: HI THIS IS BRAIN

This is exercise is simple, we have to create three variables:
- A string variable intialized to "HI THIS IS BRAIN"
- stringPTR: A pointer to string
- stringREF: A reference to string

## Program output
The subject seems to specify the following order:
- The memory address of string
- The memory address held by stringPTR
- The memory address held by stringREF
- The value of string ("HI THIS IS BRAIN")
- The value pointed to by stringPTR
- The value pointed to by stringREF
