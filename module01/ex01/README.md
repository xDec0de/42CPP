# Exercise 01:  Moar brainz
Taking the Zombie.hpp and Zombie.cpp files from ex00, we must implement a `Zombie* zombieHorde(int N, std::string name)` function on zombieHorde.cpp.

## Function requiremenets
The function must allocate N Zombie objects in a single allocation. Then, it has to initialize the zombies, giving each one of them the name passed as a parameter. returning a pointer to the first zombie.

## Tests
The subject also asks us to create a main.cpp file that must contain any tests we want to make to ensure the function works correctly.
